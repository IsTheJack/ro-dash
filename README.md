# ro-dash (under construction)
Dashboard based in layout of Prowebdesign (Free flat UI Dashboard) with some modifications. The code has coded by me.

Using SASS for write the CSS. Any help is welcome. :)

How it Works (or make this works)
===

You must have NodeJs, Bower, Gulp and SASS installed and must have the dependences installed.

First run (Download the dependences front end):
```
$ bower update
```
Later (Download others dependences):
```
$ npm install
```
At last (for work in the project):

```
$ gulp watch
```

Thanks!
